# 404

This is a 404 page for a website.

You can preview it by visit: kricsleo.com/404.html

## Components

This page is composed of lines and a '404' logo.

The line will blink at a random time setted by min-interval and max-interval.   
And the number of lines and which lines will blink are also random.   
You can also set these attributes as you like.  

The '404'logo will be teared at a random time and in a random place. You can also change these attributes.  

All I want to do is to simulate an old television screen with unstable signal.

Please see the code for more!
